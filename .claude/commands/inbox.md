# Process Inbox

Triage items in `0-Inbox/`.

## For Each Item

1. **Analyze content type** based on the content:

   | Type | Indicators | Action |
   |------|------------|--------|
   | Task | Action words, deadlines | → Project's `tasks.md` |
   | Idea | "What if", concepts | → Daily note Ideas with `#idea` |
   | Reference | Links, facts, quotes | → `4-Resources/` as note |
   | Project concept | Multi-step, has deliverable | → Discuss, then `2-Projects/` |
   | Unclear | Can't categorize | → Add `#needs-review`, move to `4-Resources/` |

2. **Route the item:**
   - Move or copy content to appropriate location
   - Add proper links and tags
   - Delete the original inbox item

3. **Update daily note:**
   - Add new notes to "🔗 Links Created" section

## After Processing All Items

Report what was processed:
```
Processed X items from inbox:
- [item name] → [destination]
- [item name] → [destination]
```

**Goal: Inbox zero.**
