# ClawdNotes Template

A shareable Obsidian vault template designed for AI-assisted note-taking with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, OpenClaw, and other AI coding assistants.

## What This Is

An opinionated, note-taking system that:
- Uses PARA organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
- Integrates seamlessly with AI assistants
- Includes automation for daily briefings, inbox processing, and reviews
- Provides clear conventions that both humans and AI can follow

**Fork this, make it yours.**
