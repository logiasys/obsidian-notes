# Weekly Review

Deep maintenance — run on Sundays (or your week's end).

**Reference:** See `docs/WEEKLY-REVIEW.md` for full process details.

## Checklist

### 1. Process Inbox (10 min)
- [ ] Review all items in `0-Inbox/`
- [ ] Route each to appropriate location
- [ ] Achieve inbox zero

### 2. Review Daily Notes (15 min)
- [ ] Scan this week's daily notes
- [ ] Extract key accomplishments
- [ ] Identify patterns or themes
- [ ] Capture significant learnings in MEMORY.md or project notes

### 3. Check Project Health (10 min)

For each project in `2-Projects/`:
- [ ] Is status emoji accurate?
- [ ] Is `tasks.md` up to date?
- [ ] Any stale tasks (7+ days untouched)?
- [ ] Should any projects be archived?

### 4. Handle Orphan Notes (5 min)
- [ ] Find notes not linked from anywhere
- [ ] Link them, move to Resources, or archive

### 5. Archive Daily Notes (10 min)

Keep `1-Daily/` lean — only recent notes stay live.

**Retention:**
- **Keep live:** Current week only (Mon–Sun)
- **Keep live:** Weekly summaries from current month only
- **Keep live:** Monthly summaries (permanent)
- **Archive everything older** → `5-Archive/1-Daily/YYYY-MM/`

**Before archiving each note:**
- [ ] Extract unfinished tasks → project `tasks.md` or `0-Inbox/`
- [ ] Extract key learnings from AI Sync → project notes or MEMORY.md
- [ ] Verify the note's week has a weekly summary (create if missing)

**Bloated notes (>100 lines):**
- Move detailed AI Sync session summaries to project `notes/`, leave a link
- Goal: daily notes should be <80 lines after cleanup

**Monthly rollup (first weekly review of a new month):**
- [ ] Consolidate previous month's weekly summaries into `YYYY-MM-monthly.md`
- [ ] Archive the individual weeklies alongside their daily notes

### 6. Archive Other Items (5 min)
- [ ] Move completed projects to `5-Archive/2-Projects/`
- [ ] Clean stale resources (not accessed in 3+ months)

### 7. Plan Next Week (5 min)
- [ ] What's the #1 priority?
- [ ] Any deadlines approaching?
- [ ] Projects needing attention?
